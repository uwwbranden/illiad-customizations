<!-- 
Fix for ILLiad openurl article requests that have "unknown" as the genre and get directed to the Loan Request form
Replaces "unknown" with "article" and redirects to new url.
Added into <head> of LoanRequest.html so the redirect can happen before the pages loads
-->
<script>
// get parameters from query string
let params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
// check if genre = unknown and an article title is included in the request
if (params.get('rft.genre') == 'unknown' && params.get('rft.atitle') != '') {
	// redirect to article request form
	window.location.replace(window.location.href.replace('rft.genre=unknown', 'rft.genre=article'));
}
</script>
